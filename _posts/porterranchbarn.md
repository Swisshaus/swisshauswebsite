## Historical Porter Ranch Barn

The construction of the barn was contracted to a builder in May of 1908 by Frank Porter, a well known logging contractor. The size, the detailed work and the structural integrity are representative of an accomplished builder.

## Interesting Facts
The Porter Ranch Barn, built in 1908, is a large two story wood frame building approximately 95 x 65 feet.

The cupolas are larger than many seen in the Flathead valley, and resemble one of the early Connecticut Valley types.2 The gambrel roof creates a larger space than other designs for hay storage, and is also better suited to handle heavy snow. Although the gambrel portion of the roof is covered in shingles, the shed roof that covers the east face of the barn is covered with corrugated steel. The red color of the barns exterior, although extremely faded, is still visible.

The post and beam structure of the barn on both the ground level and second story have common characteristics. Most timbers have been milled out of a single tree, and many are either spliced or notched together and fastened with trunnels. The form of notching used for securing the barn posts was known to be a popular method of construction from 1800 to 1875.  In addition to notching, splicing, and using trunnels, much of the structure has been carefully assembled with mortise-and-tenonjoints. Themortiseisacavity cut into the wood, and the tenon is the cut end of another piece of wood that fits into the mortise.

## Significance 

The construction of the barn was contracted to a builder in May of 1908 by Frank Porter, a well known logging contractor. 1 The size, the detailed work and the structural integrity are representative of an accomplished builder. Standing strong after 90 years, the enormous building is a local landmark symbolizing Mr. Porter's wealth and prosperity made from the local economy in which he was a pioneer. The barn is a reminder of the early settlers like Frank Porter who prospered in the Flathead valley from the timber industry, farming, and the coming of the railroad. The barn is constructed between the communities of Kalispell and Somers, Montana. Both communities grew and prospered from figures that promoted and maintained the timber industry.

Based on several newspaper articles commenting on Mr. Porter's barn, there is little doubt that he ranked with some of the wealthiest people in the surrounding communities, **and that he did indeed build the largest barn in the valley.**
