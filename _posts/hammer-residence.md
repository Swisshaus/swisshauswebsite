# W. Hammer Residence
3,300 sq ft custom home in the remote hills of Tucson, Arizona.

This large custom home is the king of the hill it was built on. The home has 360 degree views as well as a expansive interior. The front and back yard really set this home apart for us. The landscaping is so meticulously designed it feels like a resort. A timeless home. Incredible wood beams in the great room.
