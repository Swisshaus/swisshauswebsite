## Project Overview

This custom timber frame structure combines the functionality of a workshop with the design forethought to convert part of it into living space in the future. The timber frame construction showcases traditional joinery techniques and natural wood beauty while providing exceptional structural integrity.

The building features a spacious ground floor workshop with high ceilings and ample natural light. The back third of the structure and the entire second story have been designed for easy conversion into a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom residence, creating a true "barndominium" when needed.

## Construction Process

The construction process began with careful selection of timber materials and precise joinery work. Each beam was hand-finished to preserve the natural character of the wood while ensuring structural integrity. Traditional mortise and tenon joinery techniques were used throughout, secured with wooden pegs rather than metal fasteners.

## Completed Project

The finished structure stands as a testament to traditional timber framing techniques while offering modern functionality. The warm tones of the natural wood create an inviting atmosphere, while the exposed structural elements showcase the craftsmanship that went into the building.

The flexible design allows the owners to use the space as needed, starting with a functional workshop and eventually transforming sections into comfortable living quarters without major structural modifications.
